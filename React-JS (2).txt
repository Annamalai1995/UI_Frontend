 Installation
-------------
1.Node js Download and install
2.check a version in cmd -(node -v)
3.create an folder....go to that folder inside cmd
4.npm install -g create-react-app
5.create-react-app --version
6.project creationopen a folder in vs code
7.terminal --->new terminal
	(Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser)
8.create-react-app filename(create-react-app sample-frontend)
9.project is created-inside public folder only used by index.html folder only
9.inside src properties used by index.js,App.js,gitignore.....
10.run  a program
11.new terminal -cd foldername(inside a folder in terminal)
12.npm start-program is executed

React Js
----------
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is not a framework.its a liabrary.
Data flow is always in a single direction.
React is used to build single-page applications.

React allows us to create reusable UI components.

The Render Function
-------------------------
React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called ReactDOM.render().
The ReactDOM.render() function takes two arguments, HTML code and an HTML element.
The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.

 JSX
------
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

JSX allows us to write HTML in React. 

JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

DOM-Document Object Model
-------
React is virtural DOM-State change, compute ,render().....
Browser DOM-Move to browser
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

Document->Html-->head,body-->head-title,document,scriptconnection-->body-div,p,class,id......

Need to Node JS
--------------------
node js is a js runtime build on javascript engines(NPM,NPX)
NPM-Node Package Manager
 All npm packages are defined in files called package. json. The content of package.
NPX-Node Package Execute-` 

XML-Extensible Markup Language
-------
XML stands for extensible markup language. A markup language is a set of codes, or tags, that describes the text in a digital document.

JSON- Java script Object Notation
--------
Data Storage-text,pdf,doc.jpeg...........
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a text-based data interchange format to maintain the structure of the data. 
JSON is the replacement of the XML data exchange format in JSON.
JSON stores all the data in an array so data transfer makes easier. 
Thatâ€™s why JSON is the best for sharing data of any size even audio, video, etc.

Components
---------------
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return 
HTML.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons Install in react
-----------------------------------------------------
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap  

npm install bootstrap-icons

how to import in files
-------------------------
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
import 'bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css'

HOOKS
----------
React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component.

USESTATE
---------------
The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.

const[getvariablename,setvariablename]=useState()
import  {useState} from 'react';

USEEFFECT
-----------------
The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
import {useEffect} from 'react';

Router-Dom
---------------
install - npm install react-router-dom

Browser Router ----->Routes-----Route
-----------------------------------------------
We wrap our content first with <BrowserRouter>.

Then we define our <Routes>. An application can have multiple <Routes>. Our basic example only uses one.

<Route>s can be nested. The first <Route> has a path of / and renders the Layout component.

The nested <Route>s inherit and add to the parent route. So the blogs path is combined with the parent and becomes /blogs.

The Home component route does not have a path but has an index attribute. That specifies this route as the default route for the parent route, 
which is /.

React Events
----------------
Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on user events.

React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.


Material UI
--------------
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

how to use
________
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button variant="contained">Hello World</Button>
    </div>
  );
0}
